# discord_npa_bot
Semi-forked from a Discord Python Bot I have been working on for the past year. 

I originally joined the project back in Oct 2020, since then the project has grown with multiple diffrent internal and external uses. As of Summer 2021, the owner of the discord.py libary has announced retirement from his libary. Due to this, we have began to transfer to Discord JS which uses node.js for accessing Discord API calls.
